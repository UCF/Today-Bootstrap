# UCF Today Bootstrap WordPress Theme

Theme to replace the original Today WordPress theme, which relies on the Thematic framework. Written from the UCF Generic Bootstrap theme.



## Installation Requirements:
* Settings > Permalinks: set Category base to 'section'; set Tag base to 'topic' (if not already set)
* Update pages with old Blueprint markup to use Bootstrap markup
* Settings > Discussion: Make sure Trackbacks/Pingbacks are DISABLED.

## Installation Recommendations:
* Regenerate thumbnails (new [photo_sets] thumbnail size has been created)
* Update all post types to remove Pingback functionality. A lot of posts were originally created with the Pingback functionality turned on, and unfortunately they are still capable of receiving spam. Pingback functionality for posts/pages can be disabled through the WordPress interface in bulk; modify your default number of displayed posts in the Posts admin area, select all, then Bulk Edit the 'Pings' value to 'do not allow'. (http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/84633/how-to-disable-wordpress-trackback)
The primary issue with Pingbacks, though, is that media attachments allow them, and there isn't an option in the WordPress admin interface to disable them on existing attachments. To actually disable Pingbacks on every post type, a SQL statement will need to be run against the database directly: `UPDATE wp_posts SET ping_status="closed";`


## Deployment

This theme relies on Twitter's Bootstrap framework. UCF's fork of the Bootstrap project (http://github.com/UCF/bootstrap/) is added as submodule in static/bootstrap. Bootstrap must be initialized as a submodule with every new clone of this theme repository.

#### Initializing Bootstrap with a new clone:
1. Pull/Clone the theme repo
2. From the theme's root directory, run `git submodule update --init static/bootstrap`
3. From the static/bootstrap directory, run `git checkout today`.  Make sure a branch has been checked out for submodules as they will default to 'no branch' when cloned.

#### Alternative method using Git v1.6.5+:
1. Run `git clone` using the `--recursive` parameter to clone the repo with all of its submodules; e.g. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/UCF/Today-Bootstrap.git`
2. From the static/bootstrap directory, run `git checkout today`.  Make sure a branch has been checked out for submodules as they will default to 'no branch' when cloned.


## Development

This theme relies on Twitter's Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap is a CSS framework that uses LESS to programatically develop stylesheets.
UCF's fork of the Bootstrap project (http://github.com/UCF/bootstrap/) is added as submodule in static/bootstrap.

### Setup
** Note: This theme uses a version of Bootstrap whose package requirements result in Bootstrap's CSS files compiling to empty files. Follow the steps below completely to install the packages so that the `make` command works correctly. (https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/8088) **

0. If they're not already installed on your machine, install node and npm for node-related package management.
1. If this is a brand new clone, run `git submodule update --init static/bootstrap` from the theme's root directory.
2. Navigate to static/bootstrap, then run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies for building Bootstrap's .less files. These packages are excluded in the submodule .gitignore.
3. Navigate to the submodule's node_modules/recess folder, and open **package.json**. Under 'dependencies', update 'less' from '>= 1.3.0' to '1.3.3' and save. Delete node_modules/ from within the recess directory.
4. From the recess directory, run `npm install`.
5. Navigate back to the root bootstrap directory and remove the compiled bootstrap directory, if it exists.

### Compiling
Once the setup instructions above have been completed, you can compile modified .less files from the root bootstrap directory with `make bootstrap`. Compiled files will save to a new directory 'bootstrap' within the root directory (static/bootstrap/bootstrap/).

### Importing Data
Today tends to export HUGE XML files which don't import well-- use a WXR splitter (http://github.com/suhastech/Wordpress-WXR-Splitter/) to generate smaller chunks of data for import.
